# SQL in Notepad++

## Introduction

Notepad++ has an excellent plugin called CSVquery, which I have been using to process static CSV data files before I do further processing. This processing has proved to be very quick and painless. This repo contains examples of this work.

## Topics

### Number of PMs per Monarch

This analysis was done totally within Notepad++ and was an exercise to determine what I could do within NPP's MySQL implementation.

### Requirement Traceability Analysis

This folder contains my work on generating requirement trace matrices. 


### Traceability Crosscheck

Verify that the Python trace tool and Excel trace tool agree.

### Consolidated Report

After a meeting today, I decided that I needed to cleanup the report and add all sorts of explanatory text. I held a review with Regulatory today and the report format meets the need. I scheduled a meeting with upper management to convey all the database quality issues that I found during this effort. There was a lot of cleanup required that should not be necessary.
